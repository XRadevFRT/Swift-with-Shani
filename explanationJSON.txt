The best explanation of JSON I've come across!!

Here is an example of a contact record for Johnny Appleseed:

{ 	
    "type" : "person",
    "first name" : "Johnny",
    "last name" : "Appleseed",
    "nickname" : null,
    "age" : 42, 
    "phone numbers" : [
        {
            "type" : “work",
            "number" : "+1 (555) 555-5555"
        },
        {
            "type" : "home",
            "number" : null
        }
    ],
    "work address" : {
        "line 1" : "1234 5th Avenue",
        "line 2" : null,
	"city" : "Hometown"
    },
    "home address" : null
 }


Whether or not you have seen JSON before, you have probably already figured out the data 
structure: the name and age are simple attributes; the work and home addresses are objects 
(though we don’t have his home address); 
and there is a list of phone numbers, each of which is its own object.
